## Depiction

Automatically set your iOS wallpaper to pictures from an Instagram feed.

Simply select the user to use for both your lockscreen and your homescreen, and try unlocking or locking your device.

Each picture is set while you are unable to see the new picture, making wallpaper transitions seamless.

* Enable or disable for the lockscreen and homescreen separately
* Set different feeds for both the lockscreen and homescreen

Only supports public profiles. This should allow you to use most profiles that would include any pictures worthy of being your wallpaper.

Not affiliated with Instagram or Facebook. Compatible with iOS 9. Instagram not required.
